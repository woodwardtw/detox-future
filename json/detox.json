This sense of connection arises from a special kind of discrimination, a search image that comes from a long time spent looking and listening. Intimacy gives us a different way of seeing, when visual acuity is not enough.\u201d <\/i><i>\u2015 Robin Wall Kimmerer, Gathering Moss: A Natural and Cultural History of Mosses<\/i><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I\u2019ve been reflecting a lot lately on how technology shapes and influences our behaviors, engagement with, and perceptions of nature. I recently finished reading Robin Wall Kimmerer\u2019s incredibly thought-provoking <a href=\"https:\/\/milkweed.org\/book\/braiding-sweetgrass\">Braiding Sweetgrass: Indigenous Wisdom, Scientific Knowledge and the Teachings of Plants<\/a>, a book I highly recommend, and it sent my mind traveling down this tech-nature path. While Kimmerer\u2019s focus is not on technology, rather on humanity\u2019s fundamental relationship with nature, attitudes toward it, and perceptions of it, her insights got me thinking a lot about how our current technologies mediate and influence those relationships, attitudes, and perceptions.<\/p>\n<p>As a longtime outdoor enthusiast and photographer who enjoys time in remote nature, and as someone who feels intimacy in wilderness, I\u2019ve noticed some tensions in my own nature interactions in recent years \u2013 a sometimes impatience and a pull away from the present moment, a tug to check my phone, a nudge that I\u2019m dawdling too much, a restlessness that I should be elsewhere. Some of this is a reflection of me not giving myself the permission to slow down and be present in the moment, but it is also a reflection of our tech-centric world that has allowed us to be connected to both the local and the \u201cfar-away\u201d at all times. Tech <a href=\"https:\/\/dlinq.middcreate.net\/detox-2022\/post.html?id=23915\">demands our attention<\/a> in ways that are unhealthy and that sometimes distract us from intimately connecting with our immediate surroundings.<\/p>\n<p>Mobile phones, GPS, internet access, and other technologies, while undeniably beneficial, have altered both our perception of and our engagement with nature. Technology can place a wall between us, as humans, and the rest of nature. It minimizes our reliance on our own observation skills, senses, and ingenuity, and provides a false sense of sanitization and safety, as we become simply \u201ctourists\u201d in nature (with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/2013\/jul\/14\/how-selfies-became-a-global-phenomenon\">selfie culture<\/a> as one example of this), rather than a living organism that is a connected part of that nature. As we \u201ctour\u201d from place to place, we lose that intimate connection to, historical understanding of, and sense of wonder about, the places around us and the multitude of living beings that inhabit the spaces we live in and visit.<\/p>\n<p>We also often enter into nature these days with a preconceived notion of what to expect there, given the readiness of online information and data, which we are often encouraged to explore prior to going on a hike or visiting a new park, for example. As Bill Borrie, a professor of park and recreation management at the University of Montana, notes in Emily Sohn\u2019s article <a href=\"https:\/\/ensia.com\/features\/what-does-technology-do-to-our-relationship-with-the-environment\/\">What Does Technology Do to Our Relationship with the Environment?<\/a>: \u201c\u2018Being told what you should pay attention to and how you should pay attention to nature takes away from the mystery and the sense of discovery\u2026,\u2019\u201d adding \u201cthere is value to experiencing the unpredictability and even discomfort of wild places.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Even scientists whose research is centered on nature bemoan the amount of time they spend in front of a computer these days, engaging with data and doing modeling, rather than on their feet in the field. This phenomenon is sometimes referred to as \u201ckeyboard ecology,\u201d as Jordan Fisher Smith observes in his article <a href=\"https:\/\/time.com\/4355523\/digitization-of-nature\/\">How Technology Affects Our Relationship With Nature<\/a>. Fisher Smith reflects, \u201cWhat may be at risk is not only the nature of information, but human ability itself,\u201d as humans rely on technology to do basic tasks for them, like navigation, that we used to be able to do by relying on our senses and our patient observation of nature.<\/p>\n<p>Research has shown that the internet and digital technologies are shortening our attention spans and memory retention skills, and altering our decision-making and relationship-building skills, among others. Meanwhile, research on the benefits of spending time in nature (away from tech) have shown the opposite, highlighting benefits such as improved psychological wellbeing, memory function, and relationship-building skills. Richard Louv\u2019s work, ranging from his book <a href=\"http:\/\/richardlouv.com\/books\/last-child\/\">Last Child in the Woods: Saving Our Children from Nature-Deficit Disorder<\/a>, to short posts like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/commentisfree\/2014\/feb\/13\/10-reasons-why-we-need-more-contact-with-nature\">Ten Reasons Why We Need More Contact with Nature<\/a>, spotlights such research.<\/p>\n<p>Questions have arisen whether virtual time in nature is equally beneficial to real-life engagement with nature. For example, does spending time in a virtual 3-D natural environment convey benefits akin to a walk in a real forest? University of Washington psychology professor Peter Kahn, who researches these types of questions, says they are not the same, that \u201cPeople need to interact with actual nature. The solution is not just talking more about nature or creating videos of nature or other forms of technological nature. No, the solution is ever-deepening our interactions with nature and having more wild nature to interact with\u201d (from <a href=\"https:\/\/qz.com\/1048433\/technology-is-changing-our-relationship-with-nature-as-we-know-it\/\">Technology Is Changing Our Relationship with Nature as We Know It<\/a> by Andrienne Matei). Matei notes that while virtual time in nature has shown some benefits, such as lowering anxiety and promoting relaxation and joy, \u201cthere is a limit to the extent technological representations of nature can provide the soothing, restorative, creativity-enhancing benefits of a walk in the real woods.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>As we lose a connection to and intimate awareness of the real nature around us, we lose the historical reality of that environment as well, along with an understanding of what is healthy there. Kahn refers to this as environmental amnesia. In Matei\u2019s article, he warns: \u201cAll of us construct a conception of what is environmentally normal based on the natural world we encounter in our childhood. With each ensuing generation, the amount of environmental degradation increases, but each generation tends to take that degraded condition as the normal experience. This is what I have been calling \u2018environmental generational amnesia.\u2019 It helps explain how cities continue to lose nature, and why people don\u2019t really see it happening\u2014and to the extent they do, they don\u2019t think it\u2019s too much of a problem.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>While there are certainly many ways that technology has benefited our understanding of nature, and it also allows us to celebrate and showcase nature\u2019s beauty and wonder, we need to be cautious about turning to technology too often to \u201csave\u201d or interpret or engage with nature. This, it seems to me, can only come about by taking time away from tech while in nature, accepting individual and corporate responsibility to change our behaviors that damage the Earth, understanding our intimate connection to all living things, and doing away with a culture that pushes constant consumption and the commodification of everything, along with a \u201cdispose and replace\u201d mentality.<\/p>\n<p>In the words of Robin Wall Kimmerer: \u201cHow, in our modern world, can we find our way to understand the earth as a gift again, to make our relations with the world sacred again? I know we cannot all become hunter-gatherers \u2013 the living world could not bear our weight \u2013 but even in a market economy, can we behave \u2018as if\u2019 the living world were a gift?\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"hide\"><h2>Take Action<\/h2><ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Allow yourself to spend time in nature with all tech shut off and stored away.

OK, I\u2019m not completely procrastinating. I am also reflecting on the question driving this article: \u201cwhat powers the web?\u201d There\u2019s a worry behind this question\u2014<a href=\"https:\/\/www.climatecare.org\/resources\/news\/infographic-carbon-footprint-internet\/\">some estimates<\/a> put the carbon footprint of the Internet at 3.7% of total global greenhouse emissions (which is similar to the emissions of the airline industry), and that\u2019s expected to double by 2025. Technology is often viewed as a positive force for humanity\u2014a cure to our social, educational, even environmental ills\u2014but what happens when we consider the negative impacts of our increasing reliance on the Internet and its related devices and infrastructures? What if, as Neil Selwyn asks, \u201cenvironmental instability cannot be \u2018solved\u2019 simply through the expanded application of digital technologies but is actually exacerbated through increased technology use?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>When we ask \u201cwhat powers the web?\u201d, we might think of the physical infrastructure behind the Internet\u2014hardware and devices. You may have also heard about the demand for batteries built from scarce and non-renewable materials, using <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/cobalt-children-mining-democratic-republic-congo-cbs-news-investigation\/\">inhumane and polluting mining<\/a> and manufacturing processes, and shipped around the world. We might think of web servers, server farms, internet exchange points, and data warehouses which now generate significant greenhouse emissions\u2014an impact that is worsening with the <a href=\"https:\/\/news.climate.columbia.edu\/2021\/09\/20\/bitcoins-impacts-on-climate-and-the-environment\/\">growth of Web3 industries (cryptocurrencies, NFTs, etc<\/a>). The Internet is not ethereal, even though we use such language as \u201cin the cloud\u201d that obscures the very physical nature of the web, and its impacts on the environment are real (for a deeper dive into the environmental impact of the web, check out Tatiana Schlossberg\u2019s nuanced and witty <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hachettebookgroup.com\/titles\/tatiana-schlossberg\/inconspicuous-consumption\/9781538747094\/\">Inconspicuous Consumption<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>As I turn my gaze to and from the mesmerizing snow, I consider another aspect of what powers the web: Our attention. We covered attention in the <a href=\"https:\/\/dlinq.middcreate.net\/digitaldetox\/\">2020 Digital Detox<\/a>, emphasizing how we give too much of our precious attention to the web. We scroll endlessly through Instagram posts or TikTok videos; we browse and browse through Amazon recommendations and promotions; we even give long spans of attention to Netflix and Hulu via cringey-but-aptly-named \u201cbinge watching.\u201d Technology companies do a lot to keep our attention\u2014 from algorithmic filtering (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.newyorker.com\/magazine\/2019\/09\/30\/how-tiktok-holds-our-attention\">this New Yorker article on TikTok is enlightening<\/a>) to constant notifications. They show us social media posts that they know will make us angry to keep our attention; they create \u201cFOMO effects\u201d that keep us wanting to see what we\u2019re missing, what others are doing. Our attention is monetized\u2014web platforms profit from it and so they are invested in keeping our attention.<\/p>\n<p>Our attention matters\u2014if we are not careful in how we\u2019re spending it, we\u2019re likely to be sucked into the attention demands of the web and contribute to the larger environmental problem. <a href=\"https:\/\/section.iaesonline.com\/index.php\/JTI\/article\/view\/60\">Doing two internet searches, or loading one website, generates as much carbon dioxide as boiling a kettle of water<\/a> and while these atomized actions have relatively small individual impacts, the scale of the web and how we use it exacerbates the impact. For example, 70% of what we watch on YouTube is recommended to us by YouTube\u2019s algorithm, meaning its strategies to keep our attention are working. Combine that with an understanding that online video streaming and gaming account for a huge (and growing) percentage of internet traffic and you can begin to see how our attention, given to YouTube in this case, can have significant environmental impacts.<\/p>\n<p><b><i>Addressing climate change will require us to rethink every aspect of the web\u2014and that includes our attention and how we spend it.<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p>This challenge is being taken up by experts offering\u00a0 analyses and art\/visualizations that can help us recognize and be attentive to our web habits, a first step toward changing our damaging behaviors.
